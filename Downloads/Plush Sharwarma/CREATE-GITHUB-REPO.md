# 🎯 Step-by-Step: Create GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

I'm opening GitHub for you! Follow these steps:

### In the Browser Window:

1. **If not logged in:** Sign in to your GitHub account
2. **Repository name:** `plush-sharwarma`
3. **Description (optional):** `Luxury shawarma ordering experience with quantity management and animations`
4. **Visibility:** Choose **Public** (recommended) or **Private**
5. **Important:** Leave these **UNCHECKED**:
   - ❌ Add a README file
   - ❌ Add .gitignore
   - ❌ Choose a license
6. **Click:** "Create repository"

### After Repository is Created:

GitHub will show you quick setup commands. **Copy the commands** under "…or push an existing repository from the command line"

They should look like:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/plush-sharwarma.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Push Your Code

Come back here and paste those commands, or I'll provide them once you tell me your GitHub username!

**Note:** The browser window will help you create the repository. Once done, we'll push your code! 🚀
